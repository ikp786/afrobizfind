      <ol style="list-style-type:upper-alpha">
        <li>to deal with any enquiries or issues you have about how we collect, store and use your personal information, or any requests made by you for a copy of the information we hold about you. If we do not have a contract with you, we may process your personal information for these purposes where it is in our legitimate interests for customer services purposes;</li>
        <li>for internal corporate reporting, business administration, ensuring adequate insurance coverage for our business, ensuring the security of company facilities, research and development, and to identify and implement business efficiencies. We may process your personal information for these purposes where it is in our legitimate interests to do so;</li>
        <li>to comply with any procedures, laws and regulations which apply to us &ndash; this may include where we reasonably consider it is in our legitimate interests or the legitimate interests of others to comply, as well as where we are legally required to do so; and</li>

      </ol>

      <p class="pclass"><strong class="heading-2">Legal Basis for Processing</strong></p>

      <p>We consider that the legal bases for using your personal information as set out in this Privacy Policy are as follows:</p>

      <ol style="list-style-type:upper-alpha">
        <li>our use of your personal information is necessary to perform our obligations under any contract with you (for example, to fulfil an order which you place with us, to comply with the terms of use of our App which you accept by browsing our App); or</li>
        <li>our use of your personal information is necessary for complying with our legal obligations (for example, for health and safety purposes); or</li>
        <li>where neither (a) nor (b) apply, use of your personal information is necessary for our legitimate interests or the legitimate interests of others (for example, to ensure the security of our App). Our legitimate interests are to:
        <ol style="list-style-type:upper-roman">
          <li>run, grow and develop our business;</li>
          <li>operate our AFROBIZFIND app;</li>
          <li>carry out marketing, market research and business development;</li>
          <li>place, track and ensure fulfilment of orders with our suppliers; and</li>
          <li>for internal group administrative purposes</li>
        </ol>
        </li>
      </ol>

      <p>If we rely on our (or another person&#39;s) legitimate interests for using your personal information, we will undertake a balancing test to ensure that our (or the other person&#39;s) legitimate interests are not outweighed by your interests or fundamental rights and freedoms which require protection of the personal information. You can ask us for information on this balancing test by using the contact details at the end of this Privacy Policy.</p>

      <p>If we rely on your consent for us to use your personal information in a particular way, but you later change your mind, you may withdraw your consent by contacting us at INQUIRY@AFROBIZFIND.COM and we will stop doing so. However, if you withdraw your consent, this may impact the ability for us to be able to provide companies, products, offer and associated services to you (for example, we may not be able to provide marketing information to you regarding our suppliers&#39; products and services).</p>

      <p class="pclass"><strong class="heading-2">How we store your information</strong></p>

      <p>We keep your personal information for no longer than necessary for the purposes for which the personal information is processed. The length of time for which we retain personal information depends on the purposes for which we collect and use it and/or as required to comply with applicable laws and to establish, exercise or defend our legal rights. BY DELETING YOUR PERSONAL ACCOUNT THIS WILL DELETE ALL OF YOUR DATA FROM OUR RECORDS.</p>

      <p class="pclass"><strong class="heading-2">Information Security</strong></p>

      <p>For this reason, AFROBIZFIND is committed to protecting your personal information from loss, theft and misuse. We take all reasonable precautions to safeguard the confidentiality of your personal information, including through use of appropriate organisational and technical measures.</p>

      <p>In the course of provision of your personal information to us, your personal information may be transferred over the internet. Although we make every effort to protect the personal information which you provide to us, the transmission of information over the internet is not completely secure. As such, you acknowledge and accept that we cannot guarantee the security of your personal information transmitted to our App and that any such transmission is at your own risk. Once we have received your personal information, we will use strict procedures and security features to prevent unauthorised access to it.</p>
